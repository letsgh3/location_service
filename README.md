# location_service

A real-estate listings application organized as a **monorepo**: every deployable part lives in its own service under `services/`, and everything shared (requirements, CI) lives at the repo root.

The backend is built with Python (FastAPI, async SQLAlchemy 2.0, SQLite and Alembic), the frontend with React and Vite, and end-to-end tests use pytest with Playwright.

## Services

| Service | Directory | Description | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Backend | [`services/backend`](services/backend) | REST API for listings: FastAPI, async SQLAlchemy 2.0, SQLite, Alembic migrations | In development (`Location` CRUD implemented) |
| Frontend | [`services/frontend`](services/frontend) | Web UI consuming the backend API (React + Vite) | In development (`Location` list/add/delete) |
| E2E tests | [`services/e2e`](services/e2e) | Browser tests of the UI with pytest + Playwright (Python); starts backend and frontend itself | In development (auth and `Location` flows) |

Each service is self-contained: it has its own dependencies, configuration, tests and README, and is run from its own directory. Services communicate only over HTTP – the frontend talks to the backend API (by default `http://127.0.0.1:8000`).

## Getting started

Work from the directory of the service you are changing. For the backend:

```bash
cd services/backend
./setup.sh
source venv/bin/activate
python -m sql_app.init_db
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

See [`services/backend/README.md`](services/backend/README.md) for configuration, the API reference, migrations and tests.

## Conventions

- **One service, one directory.** Code, dependency manifests, `.env.example` and tests stay inside the service; do not import code across services.
- **Shared files stay at the root.** Documentation of requirements (`user_stories*.md`), CI workflows (`.github/`) and review tooling (`.agent/`) apply to the whole repository.
- **Per-service tooling config.** Claude Code settings (`CLAUDE.md`, `.claude/`) are scoped per service – start Claude Code from the service directory you are working on.
- **Schema changes ship with a migration.** Backend model changes require an Alembic migration (`alembic revision --autogenerate`); the PR review checks for it.

## Continuous integration

`.github/workflows/agent-review.yml` runs an automated AI code review on every pull request using the Codex CLI and the prompt in `.agent/review-prompt.md`. It requires an `OPENAI_API_KEY` repository secret.
